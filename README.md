## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site]https://jamessahunter.github.io/code-quiz/

The purpose of this project was to create a quiz that tests the users knowledge on some coding basics in the various technologies used to create the website in the first place. The criteria for the website was a button to start the quiz and present a timer that would decrease at a rate of one second to the user. For each question answered incorrectly the time would lose 10 seconds. The quiz ends when time reaches zero or all questions are answered. The user is then presented with their score are then allowed to enter their initials and add their score to the score board. The user is also presented with a button that will alow them to replay the quiz. This project taught me how to use event listeners to see if the user had clicked on a button or a specific element on the page. This also taught me how to append new elements to the page that did not already exist in the Document Object Model (DOM). This project included a built in timer function. This project taught me how to use local storage so that even if the page is refreshed that data is stored until it is deleted. 

## Usage

The user starts the quiz and tries to answer the questions in the alloted time. For each correct question 10 points are added to thier score as well as the time remaining once finished with the quiz. The user loses 10 seconds for every question the answer incorrectly. The user is taken to the score board and presented withe their score if their time expires or they answer all the questions. They then have the option to enter their initial and save their score to the score board

## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site]https://jamessahunter.github.io/code-quiz/

The purpose of this project was to create a quiz that tests the users knowledge on some coding basics in the various technologies used to create the website in the first place. The criteria for the website was a button to start the quiz and present a timer that would decrease at a rate of one second to the user. For each question answered incorrectly the time would lose 10 seconds. The quiz ends when time reaches zero or all questions are answered. The user is then presented with their score are then allowed to enter their initials and add their score to the score board. The user is also presented with a button that will alow them to replay the quiz. This project taught me how to use event listeners to see if the user had clicked on a button or a specific element on the page. This also taught me how to append new elements to the page that did not already exist in the Document Object Model (DOM). This project included a built in timer function. This project taught me how to use local storage so that even if the page is refreshed that data is stored until it is deleted. 

## Usage

The user enters in their desired password length between 8 and 128 and accecpts or rejects the criteria of type of characters used. Then a password is generated and displayed on the page.
